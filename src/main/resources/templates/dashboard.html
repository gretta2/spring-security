<p>HTML is comprised of several kinds of content,
    each of which is allowed to be used in certain
    contexts and is disallowed in others. Similarly,
    each context has a set of other content categories
    it can contain and elements that can or can't be used
    in them. This is a guide to these categories.</p>
