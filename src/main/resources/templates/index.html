<p>The <p> HTML element represents a paragraph.
    Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media
    as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by
    blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML
    paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related
    content, such as images or form fields.
    Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably
    will automatically close if another block-level element
    is parsed before the closing </p> tag. See "Tag omission" below.
